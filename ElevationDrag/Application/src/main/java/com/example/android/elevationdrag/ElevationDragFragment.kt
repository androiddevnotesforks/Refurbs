     * [ViewOutlineProvider] field [mOutlineProviderCircle] (generates the Outline that defines the

     * with id [R.id.main_layout] and set its [DragFrameLayout.DragFrameLayoutController] to an
     * anonymous class whose [DragFrameLayout.DragFrameLayoutController.onDragDrop] override

     * depending on whether its `captured` parameter is `true` (view is raised by 50 pixels while
     * captured), or `false` (`translationZ` is returned to 0 when dropped). We then add
     * `floatingShape` to the list of views that are draggable within the container `dragLayout`.
     *
     * We set the [OnClickListener] of the view in `rootView` with id [R.id.raise_bt] ("Z+")
     * to an anonymous class whose [OnClickListener.onClick] override adds [mElevationStep] to
     * [mElevation], logs the new elevation, and sets the base elevation of `floatingShape` to
     * [mElevation], and we set the [OnClickListener] of the view in `rootView` with id [R.id.lower_bt]
     * ("Z-") to an anonymous class whose [OnClickListener.onClick] override subtracts [mElevationStep]
     * from [mElevation] (setting to 0 if the result is less than 0), logs the new elevation, and sets
     * the base elevation of `floatingShape` to [mElevation].
     *

     * but this can be used to generate the LayoutParams of the view.
     * @param savedInstanceState If non-`null`, this fragment is being re-constructed
     * from a previous saved state as given here.

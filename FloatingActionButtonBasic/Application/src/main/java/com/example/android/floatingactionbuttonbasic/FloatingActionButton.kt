/**
 * A Floating Action Button is a [android.widget.Checkable] view distinguished by a circled icon
 * floating above the UI, with special motion behaviors. This constructor performs inflation from
 * XML and applies a class-specific base style from a theme attribute or style resource. Called by
 * our three other constructors. First we call our super's constructor. In our `init` block:
 * We call the [setClickable] method with `true` (kotlin sets the `isClickable` property to `true`)
 * to make our view clickable. We set the [ViewOutlineProvider] for this view to an anonymous
 * [ViewOutlineProvider] whose [ViewOutlineProvider.getOutline] override sets our [Outline] to an
 * oval fitting the height and width of our view. Finally we call the [setClipToOutline] method with
 * `true` to enable clipping to the outline, using the provider we set above.
 *
 * @param context The [Context] the view is running in, through which it can access the current
 * theme, resources, etc.
 * @param attrs The attributes of the XML tag that is inflating the view.
 * @param defStyleAttr An attribute in the current theme that contains a reference to a style
 * resource that supplies default values for the view. Can be 0 to not look for defaults.
 * @param defStyleRes A resource identifier of a style resource that supplies default values for the
 * view, used only if `defStyleAttr` is 0 or can not be found in the theme. Can be 0 to not look for
 * defaults.

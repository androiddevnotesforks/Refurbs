         * `FragmentManager fragmentManager` to search for a fragment with the tag NetworkFragment.TAG
         * and if the result is null we initialize it with a new instance, initialize `Bundle args`
         * with a new instance in which we store our parameter `String url` under the key URL_KEY
         * and set as the argument bundle for `networkFragment`. Then we use `fragmentManager`
         * to begin a transaction which then adds `networkFragment` using TAG as the tag and then
         * we commit the transaction. Finally we return `networkFragment` to the caller (whether we
         * are reusing an existing one or the one we had to add).

         * @return a `NetworkFragment` instance, either an existing one if `findFragmentByTag`
         * finds one or a new one created to download our parameter `String url`.

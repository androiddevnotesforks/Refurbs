     * and initialize [Button] variable `val setButton` ("Set") by finding the view with id
     * [R.id.setButton]. We initialize our [AlphaAnimation] variable `val alphaAnimation` with an
     * instance which will animate the alpha property from 1 to 0 and set its duration to 1000ms,
     * [TranslateAnimation] variable `val translateAnimation` with an instance which will animate
     * from an X value of an absolute number of pixels of 0, to an X value of 1 times the width of
     * the parent view, and from a Y value of an absolute number of pixels of 0, to a Y value of an
     * absolute number of pixels of 100, and set its duration to 1000ms. We initialize [RotateAnimation]
     * variable `val rotateAnimation` with an instance which will animate from 0 to 360 degrees, with
     * a pivot X value relative to self of .5 and a pivot Y value relative to self of .5, and set its
     * duration to 1000ms. We initialize [ScaleAnimation] variable `val scaleAnimation` with an
     * instance which will animate the scaling of X from 1 to 2 and the scaling of Y from 1 to 2
     * and set its duration to 1000ms. We initialize [AnimationSet] variable `val setAnimation` with
     * a new instance, and add `alphaAnimation`, `translateAnimation`, `rotateAnimation`, and
     * `scaleAnimation` to it. Then we call our method [setupAnimation] to setup `alphaButton` with
     * `alphaAnimation` and the resource animation [R.anim.alpha_anim], setup `translateButton` with
     * `translateAnimation` and the resource animation [R.anim.translate_anim], setup `rotateButton`

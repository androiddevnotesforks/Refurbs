 *
 * A cache that uses a bounded amount of space on a filesystem. Each cache entry has a string key
 * and a fixed number of values. Values are byte sequences, accessible as streams or files. Each
 * value must be between `0` and [Integer.MAX_VALUE] bytes in length.
 *
 * The cache stores its data in a directory on the filesystem. This directory must be exclusive to
 * the cache; the cache may delete or overwrite files from its directory. It is an error for
 * multiple processes to use the same cache directory at the same time.
 *
 * This cache limits the number of bytes that it will store on the filesystem. When the number of
 * stored bytes exceeds the limit, the cache will remove entries in the background until the limit
 * is satisfied. The limit is not strict: the cache may temporarily exceed it while waiting for
 * files to be deleted. The limit does not include filesystem overhead or the cache journal so
 * space-sensitive applications should set a conservative limit.
 *
 * Clients call [edit] to create or update the values of an entry. An entry may have only one editor
 * at one time; if a value is not available to be edited then [edit] will return `null`.
 *
 *  * When an entry is being **created** it is necessary to supply a full set of values; the empty
 *  value should be used as a placeholder if necessary.
 *
 *  * When an entry is being **edited**, it is not necessary to supply data for every value; values
 *  default to their previous value.
 *
 * Every [edit] call must be matched by a call to [Editor.commit] or [Editor.abort]. Committing is
 * atomic: a read observes the full set of values as they were before or after the commit, but never
 * a mix of values.
 *
 * Clients call [get] to read a snapshot of an entry. The read will observe the value at the time
 * that [get] was called. Updates and removals after the call do not impact ongoing reads.
 *
 * This class is tolerant of some I/O errors. If files are missing from the filesystem, the
 * corresponding entries will be dropped from the cache. If an error occurs while writing a cache
 * value, the edit will fail silently. Callers should handle other problems by catching
 * [IOException] and responding appropriately.

     * Called when the activity is starting. First we call our super's implementation of `onCreate`,
     * then we set our content view to our layout file R.layout.activity_bitmap_allocation. We
     * initialize our [IntArray] variable `val imageIDs` with the resource id's of the 6 jpg's we
     * display, initialize [CheckBox] variable `val checkbox` by finding the view in our layout with
     * id [R.id.checkbox] ("Reuse Bitmap" -- if checked the old bitmap will be reused), initialize
     * [TextView] variable `val durationTextview` by finding the view with id [R.id.loadDuration]
     * (we will display the time it took to decode and display our images here), and initialize
     * [ImageView] variable `val imageview` by finding the view with id [R.id.imageview] (we will
     * display our images here). We initialize our [BitmapFactory.Options] field [mBitmapOptions]
     * with a new instance, and set its `inJustDecodeBounds` field to `true` (the decoder will return
     * `null` (no bitmap), but the size fields of [mBitmapOptions] will still be set, allowing the
     * caller to query the bitmap without having to allocate the memory for its pixels). We then
     * call the [BitmapFactory.decodeResource] method to set the fields of [mBitmapOptions] given
     * the jpg with resource id [R.drawable.a]. We then create a bitmap for [Bitmap] field
     * [mCurrentBitmap] using the `outWidth` field of [mBitmapOptions] as the width of the bitmap
     * and the `outHeight` field as the height of the bitmap, using ARGB_8888 as the bitmap
     * configuration (each pixel is stored in 4 bytes, with each channel (RGB and alpha for
     * translucency) stored with 8 bits of precision). We then set the `inJustDecodeBounds` field
     * of [mBitmapOptions] to `false`, set its `inBitmap` field to [mCurrentBitmap] (decode methods
     * that take the `Options` object will attempt to reuse this bitmap when loading content), and
     * set its `inSampleSize` field to 1 (no sub-sampling). We then call the `decodeResource` method
     * of [BitmapFactory] to decode the jpg with resource id [R.drawable.a] into [Bitmap] field
     * [mCurrentBitmap], then set the content of [ImageView] variable `imageview` to it. Finally we
     * set the [View.OnClickListener] of `imageview` to an anonymous class which cycles through the
     * resource id's in `imageIDs` displaying each jpg in turn and reusing [mCurrentBitmap] if the
     * checkbox `checkbox` is checked.

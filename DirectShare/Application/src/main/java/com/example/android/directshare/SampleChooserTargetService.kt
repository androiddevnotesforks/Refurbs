     * First we create [ComponentName] variable `val componentName` from the name of this application's
     * package and the canonical name of the class [SendMessageActivity]. Then we initialize our
     * [ArrayList] of [ChooserTarget] variable `val targets` with a new instance. Then indexed by
     * `i` we loop through all the [Contact] objects in the [Array] of [Contact] singleton object
     * [Contact.CONTACTS] setting [Contact] variable `val contact` to the `Contact` with id `i`,
     * initializing [Bundle] variable `val extras` with a new instance then adding `i` as an extra
     * to it under the key [Contact.ID] ("contact_id"). We then add a new [ChooserTarget] to the
     * list `targets` constructed using the [Contact.name] of `contact` as the title of the target
     * that will be shown to a user, an Icon pointing to the drawable resource of the icon of
     * `contact` as the icon to represent the target, a ranking score of 0.5, `componentName` as the
     * component to be launched if this target is chosen, and `extras` as extra values to be merged
     * into the [Intent] when this target is chosen.
     *
     * When done building `targets`, we return it to the caller.

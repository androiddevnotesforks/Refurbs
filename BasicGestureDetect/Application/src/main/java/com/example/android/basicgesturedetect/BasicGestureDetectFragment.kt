/**
 * This sample detects gestures on a view and logs them. In order to try this sample out, try
 * dragging or tapping the text.
 *
 * In this sample, the gestures are detected using a custom gesture listener that extends
 * [SimpleOnGestureListener] and writes the detected [MotionEvent] into the log.
 *
 * In this example, the steps followed to set up the gesture detector are:
 *  1. Create the [GestureListener] that includes all your callbacks.
 *
 *  2. Create the [GestureDetector] that will take the [GestureListener] as an argument.
 *
 *  3. For the view where the gestures will occur, create an [View.OnTouchListener] that sends
 *  all motion events to the gesture detector.

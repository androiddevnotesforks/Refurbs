             *  * We now branch on the value of `startRect`:
             *
             *  * If `startRect` is not `null` it was visible before the data set change, and after
             *  the data set change so we animate the cell between the two positions: Initializing
             *  [Int] variable `val startTop` to the top of `startRect` and [Int] variable `val delta`
             *  to `startTop` minus `top`. We create [ObjectAnimator] variable `val animation` to
             *  animate the TRANSLATION_Y property of `child` from `delta` to 0f and add it to
             *  `animations`

             *  * If `startRect` is `null` it was not visible (or present) before the data set
             *  change but is visible after the data set change so we use its height to determine
             *  the delta by which it should be animated: initializing [Int] variable `val childHeight`
             *  to the height of `child` plus the divider height, [Int] variable `val startTop` to
             *  `top` plus `childHeight` if `i` is greater than 0 or to `top` minus `childHeight` if
             *  `i` is 0. We then initialize [Int] variable val delta` to `startTop` minus `top`,
             *  and create [ObjectAnimator] variable `val animation` to animate the TRANSLATION_Y
             *  property of `child` from `delta` to 0 then add `animation` to `animations`.
             *
             * We then remove the [Rect] stored under the key `itemId` in [HashMap] of [Long] to

             * in [HashMap] of [Long] to [BitmapDrawable] variable `listViewItemDrawables`.
             *
             * Now we loop over the [Long] variable `var itemId` keys of the cells remaining in
             * `listViewItemBounds` (these are cells that were visible before the data set changed
             * but not after):
             *
             *  * We initialize [BitmapDrawable] variable `val bitmapDrawable` with the [BitmapDrawable]
             *  stored under key `itemId` in [HashMap] of [Long] to [BitmapDrawable] variable
             *  `listViewItemDrawables` and [Rect] variable `val startBounds` with the [Rect] stored

             *
             *  * We set the bounding rectangle of `bitmapDrawable` to `startBounds` (this is where
             *  the drawable will draw when its `draw()` method is called).
             *
             *  * We initialize [Int] variable `val childHeight` to the [Rect.bottom] property of
             *  `startBounds` minus its [Rect.top] property plus the divider height, and [Rect]
             *  variable `val endBounds` to an instance initialized to the values of `startBounds`.
             *  We then offset `endBounds` by 0 in the X direction and `childHeight` in the Y

             *
             *  * We create [ObjectAnimator] variable `val animation` to animate the "bounds"

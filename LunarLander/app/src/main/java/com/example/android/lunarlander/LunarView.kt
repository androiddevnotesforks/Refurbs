/**
 * View that draws, takes keystrokes, etc. for a simple LunarLander game.
 *
 * Has a mode which RUNNING, PAUSED, etc. Has a x, y, dx, dy, ... capturing the
 * current ship physics. All x/y etc. are measured with (0,0) at the lower left.
 * updatePhysics() advances the physics based on realtime. draw() renders the
 * ship, and does an invalidate() to prompt another draw() as soon as possible
 * by the system.
 *
 * Perform inflation from XML. First we call our super's constructor, then we initialize our variable
 * `SurfaceHolder holder` with the `SurfaceHolder` of our `SurfaceView` and add
 * 'this' as a `Callback` for it (we implement `SurfaceView.Callback`). Then we initialize
 * our field `LunarThread thread` with an anonymous class whose `handleMessage` override
 * sets the visibility of `TextView mStatusText` to the value stored in the data `Bundle`
 * of its parameter `Message m` under the key "viz", and sets the text of `TextView mStatusText`
 * to the value stored in the data `Bundle` under the key "text". We then enable the focus for
 * our `LunarView` so that we get key events before returning.
 *
 * @param context The Context the view is running in
 * @param attrs   The attributes of the XML tag that is inflating the view.

         * on itself at (0,0). Then we initialize our variable `int yTop` (the top Y coordinate
         * for the drawing of the rocket ship) to our field `mCanvasHeight` minus the quantity
         * `mY` (the Y location of the ship) plus half of the lander height `mLanderHeight`.
         * We we initialize our variable `int xLeft` (the left X coordinate for the drawing of
         * the rocket ship) to our field `mX` (the X location of the ship) minus half of the width
         * of the ship `mLanderWidth`. We then draw the fuel gauge by initializing our variable
         * `int fuelWidth` to the width of the bar given by UI_BAR times the fraction of fuel
         * remaining (`mFuel` divided PHYS_FUEL_MAX). We set our scratch rectangle `RectF mScratchRect`
         * to have its left top corner at (4,4), and its right bottom corner at 4 plus `fuelWidth`
         * for the X coordinate and 4 plus UI_BAR_HEIGHT for the Y coordinate, then have `canvas`
         * draw `mScratchRect` on itself using `mLinePaint` as the `Paint`. We next
         * want to draw the speed gauge with a two-tone effect and to do this we initialize `double speed`
         * to the square root of `mDX` squared plus `mDY` squared (the length of the speed
         * vector given the X velocity and Y velocity), then initialize `int speedWidth` to `speed`
         * divided by PHYS_SPEED_MAX times the size of our UI bar UI_BAR. If `speed` is less than

         * left corner at 4 plus UI_BAR plus 4 for the X coordinate, 4 for the Y coordinate and its
         * bottom right corner at 4 plus UI_BAR plus 4 plus `speedWidth` for the X coordinate
         * and 4 plus UI_BAR_HEIGHT for the Y coordinate. We then have `canvas` draw `mScratchRect`
         * on itself using `mLinePaint` as the paint. If on the other hand `speed` is greater
         * than `mGoalSpeed` we want to draw the bad color in back, with the good color in front
         * of it, so we set the rectangle `mScratchRect` to have its upper left corner at 4 plus
         * UI_BAR plus 4 for the X coordinate, 4 for the Y coordinate and its bottom right corner at 4
         * plus UI_BAR plus 4 plus `speedWidth` for the X coordinate and 4 plus UI_BAR_HEIGHT for
         * the Y coordinate. We then have `canvas` draw `mScratchRect` on itself using
         * `mLinePaintBad` as the paint. We then initialize `int goalWidth` to be `mGoalSpeed`
         * divided by `PHYS_SPEED_MAX` times UI_BAR, and set the rectangle `mScratchRect` to
         * have its upper left corner at 4 plus UI_BAR plus 4 for the X coordinate, 4 for the Y coordinate and its
         * bottom right corner at 4 plus UI_BAR plus 4 plus `goalWidth` for the X coordinate and 4 plus
         * UI_BAR_HEIGHT for the Y coordinate. We then have `canvas` draw `mScratchRect` on itself
         * using `mLinePaint` as the paint.

         *
         * We now want to draw the landing pad, so we have `canvas` draw a line on itself from
         * (`mGoalX`,1+`mGoalX`-TARGET_PAD_HEIGHT) to
         * (`mGoalX`+`mGoalWidth`,1+`mCanvasHeight`-TARGET_PAD_HEIGHT) using
         * `mLinePaint` as the paint.
         *
         *
         * Now we want to draw the ship with its current rotation so we have `canvas` save the
         * current matrix and clip onto a private stack, then rotate `canvas` by `mHeading`
         * degrees around the point (`mX`,`mCanvasHeight`-`mY`). If the game state
         * `mMode` is STATE_LOSE we set the bounding rectangle of `mCrashedImage` to a
         * rectangle whose left top corner is (`xLeft`,`yTop`) and whose right bottom corner
         * is (`xLeft`+`mLanderWidth`,`yTop`+`mLanderHeight`). We then have
         * `mCrashedImage` draw itself on `canvas`. If on the other hand `mEngineFiring`
         * is firing we set the bounding rectangle of `mFiringImage` to a rectangle whose left
         * top corner is (`xLeft`,`yTop`) and whose right bottom corner is
         * (`xLeft`+`mLanderWidth`,`yTop`+`mLanderHeight`). We then have

         *
         *

         * nothing (our game start sets `mLastTime` to 100ms in the future to delay the start
         * of the game). Otherwise we initialize `double elapsed` to the quantity `now`
         * minus `mLastTime` all divided by 1000.0 (the time that has elapsed since `mLastTime`
         * in seconds). If our field `int mRotating` is not zero we want to update our heading
         * so we add `mRotating` times PHYS_SLEW_SEC, times `elapsed` to our heading field

         *

         * (gravity for y: minus PHYS_DOWN_ACCEL_SEC times `elapsed`). If `mEngineFiring` is
         * true (the rocket engine is firing) we need to adjust these so we initialize `double elapsedFiring`

         * add `elapsed` times the quantity `mDX` plus `dxOld` all divided by 2 to
         * `mX`, and add `elapsed` times the quantity `mDY` plus `dyOld` all

         * if `mY` is now less than or equal to `yLowerBound` the Eagle has landed and we
         * need to see if we won or lost (if it is still greater the game goes on and our method is done).
         * To determine if we won or lost we set `mY` to `yLowerBound`, initialize `int result`
         * to STATE_LOSE, `CharSequence message` to the empty string, `Resources res` to a
         * `Resources` instance for the application's package, `double speed` to the magnitude
         * of the vector (`mDX`,`mDY`), and `boolean onGoal` to the value of the inequality
         * `mGoalX` is less than or equal to `mX` minus half of `mLanderWidth`, and
         * `mX` plus half of `mLanderWidth` is less than or equal to `mGoalX` plus
         * `mGoalWidth` (when true we are on the landing pad). Next we check to see if we have
         * achieved the oddball "Hyperspace" win (upside down, going fast) which happens when `onGoal`
         * is true and the absolute value of `mHeading` minus 180 is less than `mGoalAngle`
         * and `speed` is greater than PHYS_SPEED_HYPERSPACE, in which case we increment `mWinsInARow`
         * call our `doStart` method to restart the game back at the top and then we return.
         *
         *
         * In all other cases we need to evaluate whether we have failed to achieve our goals, so we
         * proceed to branch evaluating each in turn:
         *
         *  *
         * `onGoal` is false: (we have missed the landing pad) We set `message` to the
         * string with resource id R.string.message_off_pad.
         *
         *  *
         * `mHeading` is greater than `mGoalAngle` or less than 360 minus `mGoalAngle`
         * (Bad Angle) We set `message` to the string with resource id R.string.message_bad_angle.
         *
         *  *
         * `speed` is greater than `mGoalSpeed` (Too Fast) We set `message` to the
         * string with resource id R.string.message_too_fast.
         *
         *  *
         * If we succeed in avoiding loss due to the above tests we set `result` to STATE_WIN
         * and increment `mWinsInARow`
         *
         *
         * Finally we call our `setState` method to set the game state to `result` and display
         * `message` (if we lost that is, it is still the empty string if we won).

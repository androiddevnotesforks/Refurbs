/**
 * This application shows a simple technique to animate and overlay two fragments
 * on top of each other in order to provide a more immersive experience,
 * as opposed to only having full screen transitions. When additional content
 * (text) related to the currently displayed content (image) is to be shown,
 * the currently visible content can be moved into the background instead of
 * being removed from the screen entirely. This effect can therefore
 * provide a more natural way of displaying additional information to the user
 * using a different fragment.
 *
 *
 * In this specific demo, tapping on the screen toggles between the two
 * animated states of the fragment. When the animation is called,
 * the fragment with an image animates into the background while the fragment
 * containing text slides up on top of it. When the animation is toggled once
 * more, the text fragment slides back down and the image fragment regains
 * focus. See [...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbl5cxfA1n4)

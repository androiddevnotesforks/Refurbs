     * long-running tasks can be run *in situ*, and you don't have to set up a separate thread
     * for them. This is where we actually perform any work required to perform a sync.
     * [AbstractThreadedSyncAdapter] guarantees that this will be called on a non-UI thread,
     * so it is safe to perform blocking I/O here.

     * ("http://android-developers.blogspot.com/atom.xml"), and declare [InputStream] variable
     * `var stream` to be `null`. Wrapped in an inner try block intended to catch exceptions with
     * a finally block that makes sure `stream` is closed exception or not, we initialize
     * `stream` with the [InputStream] returned by our method [downloadUrl] for [URL] `location`.
     * We then call our method [updateLocalFeedData] with `stream` and our [SyncResult] parameter
     * [syncResult] to Read XML from the input stream, storing it into the content provider.
     *
     * The catch blocks for the outer try block all log the exception, and increment the field in
     * the `stats` field of our [SyncResult] parameter [syncResult] reserved for that particular
     * exception:
     *
     *  * [MalformedURLException] - Thrown to indicate that a malformed [URL] has occurred. Either

     *
     *  * [IOException] - Signals that an I/O exception of some sort has occurred. This class is the
     *  general class of exceptions produced by failed or interrupted I/O operations. Increments
     *  `numIoExceptions`.
     *
     *  * [XmlPullParserException] - This exception is thrown to signal XML Pull Parser related
     *  faults. Increments `numParseExceptions`
     *
     *  * [ParseException] - Signals that an error has been reached unexpectedly while parsing.
     *  Increments `numParseExceptions`
     *
     *  * [RemoteException] - Parent exception for all Binder remote-invocation errors.
     *  Increments `databaseError`. Used to indicate that the SyncAdapter experienced a
     *  hard error due to an error it received from interacting with the storage layer. The
     *  SyncManager will record that the sync request failed and it will not reschedule the
     *  request.
     *
     *  * [OperationApplicationException] - Thrown when an application of a ContentProviderOperation
     * (Represents a single operation to be performed as part of a batch of operations)
     * fails due to the specified constraints. Increments `databaseError`
     *

    /**
     * Read XML from an input stream, storing it into the content provider. This is where incoming
     * data is persisted, committing the results of a sync. In order to minimize (expensive) disk
     * operations, we compare incoming data with what's already in our database, and compute a
     * merge. Only changes (insert/update/delete) will result in a database write. As an additional
     * optimization, we use a batch operation to perform all database writes at once.
     *
     * Merge strategy:
     *
     *  1. Get cursor to all items in feed
     *  2. For each item, check if it's in the incoming data.
     *
     *      a. YES: Remove from "incoming" list. Check if data has mutated, if so, perform
     *      database UPDATE.
     *
     *      b. NO: Schedule DELETE from database.
     *
     *  3. At this point, incoming database only contains missing items. For any items remaining
     *  in incoming list, ADD to database.
     *
     * First we initialize [FeedParser] variable `val feedParser` with a new instance (our
     * [FeedParser] class parses generic Atom feeds). Then we initialize [ContentResolver] variable
     * `val contentResolver` with a [ContentResolver] instance for our application's package. Then
     * we fill our [List] of [FeedParser.Entry] variable `val entries` with the entries that the
     * [FeedParser.parse] method of `feedParser` parses from its reading of our [InputStream]
     * parameter [stream]. We initialize our [ArrayList] of [ContentProviderOperation] variable
     * `val batch` with a new [ArrayList], and our [HashMap] of [String] to [FeedParser.Entry]
     * `val entryMap` with a new [HashMap]. Then for every [FeedParser.Entry]  `e` in `entries` we
     * store `e` under the key `e.id` in `entryMap`.
     *
     * We now initialize [Uri] variable `val uri` with the [Uri] for all entries in our local
     * database CONTENT_URI ("content://com.example.android.basicsyncadapter/entries") and
     * initialize [Cursor] variable `val c` with the results of querying `uri` using the projection
     * [PROJECTION]. We declare [Int] variable `var id`, [String] variable `var entryId`, [String]
     * variable `var title`, [String] variable `var link`, and [Long] variable `var published`
     * (these variables will hold the columns we read from each row of [Cursor] `c` in the loop
     * to follow).
     *
     * We now loop for all the rows in [Cursor] `c` first incrementing the `numEntries` field of the
     * `stats` field of [SyncResult] parameter [syncResult] (Counter for tracking how many entries
     * were affected by the sync operation, as defined by the [SyncAdapter]). Reading from [Cursor]
     * `c` we set `id` to the int stored in column [COLUMN_ID], `entryId` to the string stored in
     * [COLUMN_ENTRY_ID], `title` to the string stored in column [COLUMN_TITLE], `link` to the string
     * stored in [COLUMN_LINK], and `published` to the [Long] stored in column [COLUMN_PUBLISHED].
     * We next try to fetch [FeedParser.Entry] variable `val match` from the entry in `entryMap`
     * stored under key `entryId`. If `match` is:
     *
     *  * not `null` - we remove it from `entryMap` to avoid inserting it again later. We create
     *  [Uri] variable `val existingUri` to point to the [Uri] for this entry. Then if any of the
     *  fields `title`, `link`, or `published` have changed we call the `newUpdate` method of
     *  [ContentProviderOperation] to create a builder for building an update [ContentProviderOperation]
     *  for updating `existingUri` which we proceed to set values for [FeedContract.Entry.COLUMN_NAME_TITLE],
     *  [FeedContract.Entry.COLUMN_NAME_LINK], and [FeedContract.Entry.COLUMN_NAME_PUBLISHED] using
     *  `withValue` from the values for these columns in [FeedParser.Entry] `match`. We then build
     *  this builder and add the [ContentProviderOperation] to our list `batch`. We then increment
     *  the `numUpdates` field of the `stats` field of `syncResult`, and loop back for the next
     *  [FeedParser.Entry].
     *
     *  * null - we just log "No action: "
     *
     * After handling all the rows in [Cursor] `c` we close `c`, and move on to add the values in
     * `entryMap` that are new. To do this we loop through all the [FeedParser.Entry] `var e` that
     * remain in `entryMap` creating a Builder suitable for building an insert [ContentProviderOperation],
     * then proceeding to set values for [FeedContract.Entry.COLUMN_NAME_ENTRY_ID],
     * [FeedContract.Entry.COLUMN_NAME_TITLE], [FeedContract.Entry.COLUMN_NAME_LINK], and
     * [FeedContract.Entry.COLUMN_NAME_PUBLISHED] using `withValue` from the values for these columns
     * in `e`. We then build this builder and add the [ContentProviderOperation] to our list `batch`.
     * We then increment the `numInserts` field of the `stats` field of [syncResult], and loop
     * back for the next [FeedParser.Entry] `e`.
     *
     * Having filled `batch` with [ContentProviderOperation] objects we call the `applyBatch` method
     * of our [ContentResolver] field [mContentResolver] to apply the transactions in `batch` to
     * [FeedContract.CONTENT_AUTHORITY] ("com.example.android.basicsyncadapter"). We then call the
     * [ContentResolver.notifyChange] method of [mContentResolver] to notify registered observers
     * that a row was updated for the [Uri] of [FeedContract.Entry.CONTENT_URI]
     * ("content://com.example.android.basicsyncadapter/entries")
     *
     * @param stream [InputStream] we are to read from
     * @param syncResult [SyncResult] we are to update when done.

 * our field [mObservableProducts] to be a [MediatorLiveData] wrapped [List] of [ProductEntity] and
 * initialize it to a new instance and set its value to `null` in our init block. Also in our init
 * block we initialize [LiveData] wrapped [List] of [ProductEntity] field [products] by launching an
 * asynchronous query to our database to retrieve the list of [ProductEntity] objects in it, and
 * finally we add an observer for [products] whose `onChanged` method is the `setValue` method of
 * [mObservableProducts].
 *

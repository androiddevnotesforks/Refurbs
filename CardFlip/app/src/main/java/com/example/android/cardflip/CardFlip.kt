/**
 * This application creates 2 stacks of playing cards. Using fling events, these cards can be
 * flipped from one stack to another where each flip comes with an associated animation. The cards
 * can be flipped horizontally from left to right or right to left depending on which stack the
 * animating card currently belongs to.
 *
 * This application demonstrates an animation where a stack of cards can either be
 * be rotated out or back in about their bottom left corner in a counter-clockwise direction.
 *
 *  * Rotate out: Down fling on stack of cards
 *
 *  * Rotate in: Up fling on stack of cards
 *
 *  * Full rotation: Tap on stack of cards
 *
 * Note that in this demo touch events are disabled in the middle of any animation so only one card
 * can be flipped at a time. When the cards are in a rotated-out state, no new cards can be rotated
 * to or from that stack. These changes were made to simplify the code for this demo.

         *  * [MotionEvent.ACTION_CANCEL]: We call our method [setSwipePosition] to set the X

         *  I suppose you could conceivably start another swipe while the animation of a previous
         *  one is in progress, but since the [ListView] is disabled and un-clickable during the
         *  animation I do not think it possible). Otherwise we initialize [Float] variable

         *  coordinate of [View] paramter [v] for the height of [v]. Then if [mSwiping] is now
         *  `true` we call our [setSwipePosition] method to translate the X position on the screen
         *  of [v] to `deltaX`.
         *
         *  * [MotionEvent.ACTION_UP]: if our [Boolean] field [mAnimating] is `true` we return
         *  `true` having done nothing (we are already animating the movement of a view off or
         *  back onto the screen). Otherwise we branch on the value of our [Boolean] flag field
         *  [mSwiping]:
         *
         *  * `true`: (the item has been moved already) We set [Float] variable `val x` to the X
         *  coordinate of [MotionEvent] parameter [event] and if our device is post Gingerbread we
         *  add the X translation of [View] parameter [v] to `x`. We set [Float] variable
         *  `val deltaX` to `x` minus [Float] field [mDownX], and [Float] variable `val deltaXAbs`
         *  to the absolute value of `deltaX`. We declare [Float] variable `val fractionCovered`,
         *  [Float] variable `val endX`, and [Boolean] variable `val remove`. If `deltaXAbs` is
         *  greater than one quarter of the width of [View] parameter [v] we animate it off the
         *  screen by setting `fractionCovered` to `deltaXAbs` divided by the width of [v], setting
         *  `endX` to minus the width of [v] if `deltaX` is less than 0, or to the width of [v] if

         *  width of [v], setting `endX` 0, and setting `remove` to `false`. In either case we set
         *  [Long] variable `val duration` to the quantity 1 minus `fractionCovered` times
         *  [SWIPE_DURATION] then call our [animateSwipe] method to animate the X coordinate of [v]

     * to send the item off or back at an appropriate speed. First we set our [Boolean] field
     * [mAnimating] to `true`, then we disable our [ListView] field [mListView]. We then branch on

     *  duration to our [Long] parameter [duration], cause it to animate the alpha of [view] to 0 if
     *  [Boolean] parameter [remove] is `true` or to 1 if it is `false`, cause it to animate the X
     *  translation to [Float] parameter [endX] and set its [AnimatorListener] to an anonymous
     *  [AnimatorListenerAdapter] whose [AnimatorListenerAdapter.onAnimationEnd] override sets the
     *  alpha of [view] back to 1, and its X translation to 0. Then if [remove] is `true` calls our
     *  [animateOtherViews] method to animate the other views in the [ListView] container (not
     *  including [view]) into their final positions. If [remove] is false we call the
     *  [BackgroundContainer.hideBackground] method of [mBackgroundContainer] to hide the background
     *  again, set the [Boolean] flag fields [mSwiping], and [mAnimating] to `false` and enable
     *  [ListView] field [mListView] again. In either case we then set [Boolean] field [mItemPressed]
     *  to `false`.
     *
     *  * Before Gingerbread: We initialize [TranslateAnimation] variable `val swipeAnim` with an
     *  instance which will animate the X coordinate from [Float] field [mCurrentX] to [Float]
     *  parameter [endX] with no change to the Y coordinate. We initialize [AlphaAnimation] variable
     *  `val alphaAnim` with an instance which will animate the alpha from [Float] field
     *  [mCurrentAlpha] to 0 if [Boolean] parameter [remove] is `true` or to 1 if it is `false`. We
     *  initialize [AnimationSet] variable `val set` with an instance which will share the
     *  interpolator with all the animations in it. We then add `swipeAnim`, and `swipeAnim` to
     *  `set`, set its duration to [Long] parameter [duration], and start it running now on [view].
     *  We then call our [setAnimationEndAction] method to set the [AnimationListener] of `set` to
     *  an anonymous [AnimationListenerAdapter] whose [AnimationListenerAdapter.onAnimationEnd]
     *  override runs an anonymous [Runnable] we pass it which handles changes to the other views in
     *  the [ListView] brought about when [view] is either removed or returned to its original

     * [ImageView] variable `val imageView` by finding the view with id [R.id.image_view]. We
     * initialize both [Bitmap] variable `val bitmap0` and [Bitmap] variable `val bitmap1` with 500
     * by 500 pixel bitmaps with a config of ARGB_8888. We initialize [Canvas] variable `var canvas`
     * with an instance that will draw into `bitmap0` then call its [Canvas.drawColor] method to fill
     * its entire bitmap with the color [Color.RED] using `srcover` porterduff mode. We then set
     * `canvas` to a new instance that will draw into `bitmap1` and call its [Canvas.drawColor]
     * method to fill its entire bitmap with the color [Color.GREEN]. We allocate 2 entries to
     * initialize [Array] of [BitmapDrawable] `val drawables`, then set `drawables[0]` to an instance
     * created from `bitmap0`, and `drawables[1]` to an instance created from `bitmap1`. We
     * initialize [TransitionDrawable] variable `val crossfader` with an instance created from
     * `drawables` then set the content of `imageView` to it. Finally we set the [OnClickListener]
     * of `imageView` to an anonymous class whose [OnClickListener.onClick] override branches on the
     * value of [Int] field [mCurrentDrawable]:
     *
     *  * 0: calls the [TransitionDrawable.startTransition] method of `crossfader` with a duration
     *  of 500 milliseconds  to transition the second layer on top of the first layer (taking 500ms
     *  to do so), then sets [mCurrentDrawable] to 1.
     *
     *  * 1: calls the [TransitionDrawable.reverseTransition] method of `crossfader` with a duration
     *  of 500 milliseconds to reverse the transition, picking up where the transition currently is
     *  (taking 500ms to do so), then sets [mCurrentDrawable] to 0.
     *
     * @param savedInstanceState we do not override [onSaveInstanceState] so do not use.

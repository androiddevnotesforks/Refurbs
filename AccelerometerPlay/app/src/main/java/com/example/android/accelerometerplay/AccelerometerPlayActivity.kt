     * security, it will never re-appear if the user navigates to another window (in contrast
     * to FLAG_SHOW_WHEN_LOCKED, which will only temporarily hide both secure and non-secure
     * keyguards but ensure they reappear when the user moves to another UI that doesn't hide
     * them). If the keyguard is currently active and is secure (requires an unlock credential)
     * than the user will still need to confirm it before seeing this window, unless
     * FLAG_SHOW_WHEN_LOCKED has also been set.
     *
     *  *
     * FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON: as long as this window is visible to the user, keep the device's
     * screen turned on and bright.
     *
     *  *
     * FLAG_TURN_SCREEN_ON: when set as a window is being added or made visible, once the
     * window has been shown then the system will poke the power manager's user activity
     * (as if the user had woken up the device) to turn the screen on.
     *
     *  *
     * FLAG_ALLOW_LOCK_WHILE_SCREEN_ON: as long as this window is visible to the user, allow
     * the lock screen to activate while the screen is on.

         * which the event happened in `mSensorTimeStamp`. We initialize `sx` by copying
         * the value of `mSensorX` (X component of the current SensorEvent, after taking into
         * account the rotation of the screen with respect to the sensors) to it, and `sy` by
         * copying the value of `mSensorY` (Y component of the current SensorEvent, after taking
         * into account the rotation of the screen with respect to the sensors) to it. We then call
         * the `update` method of `particleSystem` with  `sx`, `sy`, and `now`
         * to have it update all of the positions of the particles in it given the current sensor event.
         *
         *
         * We now create copies of our fields as follows:
         *
         *  *
         * `float xc` gets `mXOrigin` (X coordinate of the origin of the screen
         * relative to the origin of the bitmap
         *
         *  *
         * `float yc` gets `mYOrigin` (Y coordinate of the origin of the screen
         * relative to the origin of the bitmap
         *
         *  *
         * `float xs` gets `mMetersToPixelsX` (exact physical pixels per meters
         * of the screen in the X dimension)
         *
         *  *
         * `float ys` gets `mMetersToPixelsY` (exact physical pixels per meters
         * of the screen in the Y dimension)
         *
         *  *
         * `Bitmap bitmap` gets `mBitmap` (scaled Bitmap containing our ball)
         *
         *
         * We then initialize `int count` with the number of balls in `particleSystem` in
         * order to use it as the limit in a for loop over `int i`, where we:
         *
         *  *
         * Initialize `float x` by adding `xc` to `xs` times the X position
         * of the `Particle` in `particleSystem` at position `i`
         *
         *  *
         * Initialize `float y` by adding `yc` to `xs` times the Y position
         * of the `Particle` in `particleSystem` at position `i`
         *
         *  *
         * We then have our parameter `canvas` draw `bitmap` at `(x,y)` with
         * a null paint.
         *
         *
         * Having drawn all the balls we call the `invalidate` method to ensure that we will be
         * called again at some point in the future.

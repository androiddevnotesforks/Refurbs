/**
 * The [DynamicListView] is an extension of [ListView] that supports cell dragging and swapping.
 * This layout is in charge of positioning the hover cell in the correct location on the screen in
 * response to user touch events. It uses the position of the hover cell to determine when two cells
 * should be swapped. If two cells should be swapped, all the corresponding data set and layout
 * changes are handled here.
 *
 * If no cell is selected, all the touch events are passed down to the [ListView] and behave
 * normally. If one of the items in the [ListView] experiences a long press event, the contents of
 * its current visible state are captured as a bitmap and its visibility is set to INVISIBLE. A
 * hover cell is then created and added to this layout as an overlaying [BitmapDrawable] above the
 * [ListView]. Once the hover cell is translated some distance to signify an item swap, a data set
 * change accompanied by animation takes place. When the user releases the hover cell, it animates
 * into its corresponding position in the [ListView].
 *
 * When the hover cell is either above or below the bounds of the [ListView], this [ListView] also
 * scrolls on its own so as to reveal additional content.

    /**
     * This method determines whether the hover cell has been shifted far enough to invoke a cell
     * swap. If so, then the respective cell swap candidate is determined and the data set is
     * changed. Upon posting a notification of the data set change, a layout is invoked to place the
     * cells in the right place. Using a [ViewTreeObserver] and a corresponding [OnPreDrawListener],
     * we can offset the cell being swapped to where it previously was and then animate it to its
     * new position.
     *
     * First we initialize [Int] variable `val deltaY` by subtracting [Int] field [mDownY] from [Int]
     * field [mLastEventY] (giving us the plus or minus distance on the screen we have moved since
     * the initial long click, or the last time a cell was swapped -- it is set to [mLastEventY]
     * every time a cell is swapped). Then we initialize [Int] variable `val deltaYTotal` by adding
     * the [Rect.top] field of [Rect] field [mHoverCellOriginalBounds] to [Int] field [mTotalOffset]
     * plus `deltaY` (this is the current position of the top of the hover cell). We initialize [View]
     * variable `val belowView` with the view with the id of [Long] field [mBelowItemId], [View]
     * variable `val mobileView` with the view with the id of [Long] field [mMobileItemId], and
     * [View] variable `val aboveView` with the view with the id of [Long] field [mAboveItemId]. We
     * initialize [Boolean] variable `val isBelow` to `true` if `belowView` is not `null` and
     * `deltaYTotal` is greater than the top Y coordinate of `belowView`. We initialize [Boolean]
     * variable `val isAbove` to `true` if `aboveView` is not `null` and `deltaYTotal` is less than
     * the top Y coordinate of `aboveView`. If either `isBelow` or `isAbove` is `true` we need to
     * switch cells:
     *
     *  * We initialize [Long] variable `val switchItemID` to [mBelowItemId] if `isBelow` is `true`
     *  or to [mAboveItemId] if it is `false`, and initialize [View] variable `val switchView` to
     *  `belowView` if `isBelow` is true or to `aboveView` if it is false.
     *
     *  * We initialize [Int] variable `val originalItem` with the position in our [AdapterView]'s
     *  dataset that the [getPositionForView] method calculates for `mobileView`.
     *
     *  * If `switchView` is `null` we call our method [updateNeighborViewsForID] to update the item
     *  id's in [mAboveItemId] and [mBelowItemId] to values for the item id [mMobileItemId] (the
     *  items before and after the hover cell's item id). I cannot find a case where `switchView`
     *  can possibly be null, the logic before this statement guaranties that it is either
     *  `belowView` or `aboveView`!
     *
     *  * We call our method [swapElements] to swap the data items at position `originalItem` (the
     *  item being dragged) with the item at the position occupied by `switchView` in our [ArrayList]
     *  of [String] dataset field[mCheeseList]. We then call the [StableArrayAdapter.notifyDataSetChanged]
     *  method of our adapter to notify it that the dataset changed and the [ListView] needs to be
     *  redrawn.
     *
     *  * We set [Int] field [mDownY] to [Int] field [mLastEventY], and initialize [Int] variable
     *  `val switchViewStartTop` to the top Y coordinate of `switchView`.
     *
     *  * We set the visibility of `mobileView` to VISIBLE and the visibility of `switchView` to
     *  INVISIBLE, then we call our [updateNeighborViewsForID] method to have it update the values
     *  of [Long] field [mAboveItemId] (the id of the item that is now above the long clicked item
     *  on the screen given the new location of the item with id of [Long] field [mMobileItemId]),
     *  and [Long] field [mBelowItemId] (the id of the item that is now below the long clicked item
     *  on the screen given the new location of the item with id [mMobileItemId]).
     *
     *  * We initialize [ViewTreeObserver] variable `val observer` with the [ViewTreeObserver] for
     *  this view's hierarchy and add to it an anonymous [OnPreDrawListener] which animates the view
     *  containing the item with id `switchItemID` into its new position on the screen, and then

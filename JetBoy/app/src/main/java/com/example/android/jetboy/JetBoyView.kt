 * `this` as a [SurfaceHolder.Callback] to it. If we are not in edit mode (edit mode is `true` when
 * we are displayed within a developer tool like a layout editor) we initialize [JetBoyThread] field
 * [thread] (thread that actually draws the animation) with a new instance that uses an anonymous
 * [Handler] whose [Handler.handleMessage] override updates the timer [TextView] field [mTimerView]
 * with the string that is stored in the data [Bundle] of the message it receives under the key
 * "text", then if there is a string stored in the [Bundle] under the key "STATE_LOSE" it evaluates
 * whether the player has won or lost and updates the state of the UI accordingly. Whether we are
 * in edit mode or not we set ourselves to be focusable, and log the fact that we are done creating
 * the view.
 *
 * @param context The [Context] the view is running in, through which it can access the current
 * theme, resources, etc.

     *  pointer (ACTION_DOWN) has already been received) We initialize [Int] variable `val index`
     *  with the associated pointer index of [event], and [Int] variable `val id` with the pointer
     *  identifier associated the pointer data index `index` in this event (the [MotionEvent]
     *  object contains multiple pointers, so we need to find the index at which the data for
     *  the ACTION_POINTER_DOWN action is stored). We then initialize [TouchHistory] variable

     *  components set to the values of the x, y, and pressure components from pointer index
     *  `index` of [event]. We then set the `label` field of `data` to a string formed by
     *  concatenating the string value of `id` to the string "id: ". We then store `data` under
     *  the index `id` to our [SparseArray] of [TouchHistory] field [mTouches].
     *
     *  * ACTION_UP: (Final pointer has gone up and has ended the last pressed gesture) We retrieve
     *  the pointer identifier associated with this event from pointer index 0 (it will be the only
     *  event stored in the [MotionEvent] object) of [event] in order to initialize [Int] variable
     *  `val id`. We initialize [TouchHistory] variable `val data` with the [TouchHistory] object
     *  stored under key `id` in [mTouches], remove that entry from [mTouches] and then recycle
     *  `data`. We then set [mHasTouch] to `false`.
     *
     *  * ACTION_POINTER_UP: (A non-primary pointer has gone up and other pointers are still active)
     *  We initialize [Int] variable `val index` with the associated pointer index of [event], and
     *  [Int] variable `val id` with the pointer identifier associated the pointer data index `index`
     *  in this event (the [MotionEvent] object contains multiple pointers, so we need to find the
     *  index at which the data for the ACTION_POINTER_UP action is stored). We initialize
     *  [TouchHistory] variable `val data` with the [TouchHistory] object stored under key `id`
     *  in [mTouches], remove that entry from [mTouches], and recycle `data`.
     *
     *  * ACTION_MOVE: (A change event happened during a pressed gesture. (Between ACTION_DOWN and
     *  ACTION_UP or ACTION_POINTER_DOWN and ACTION_POINTER_UP)) We loop over `index` from 0 for
     *  the number of pointers of data contained in [event] (the value returned by the method
     *  [MotionEvent.getPointerCount] of [event], aka kotlin `pointerCount` property) initializing
     *  [Int] variable `val id` to the pointer identifier associated with the pointer data index
     *  `index`. We initialize [TouchHistory] variable `val data` by fetching the object stored at
     *  `id` in our [SparseArray] of [TouchHistory] field [mTouches]. We then add the previous X and
     *  Y coordinates of `data` (the `x` and `y` fields) to the history of `data`. Finally we update
     *  the `x`, `y`, and `pressure` fields of `data` with the X, Y, and pressure values for [event]
     *  for the pointer index `index` before looping back for the next pointer index.
     *
     * When done dealing with the [MotionEvent] we invalidate ourselves to trigger redraw on the UI
     * thread and return `true` to the caller to consume the event.

     * `val radius` to our field [mCircleRadius] multiplied by `pressure`. We then draw a circle on

     * value. We then loop over [Int] variable `var j` for all of the [PointF] entries in the array
     * of [PointF] `history` field of `data` (the `historyCount` field of `data` is the number
     * currently in the array, but for extra safety we also limit ourselves to the total size of
     * the `history` field). We initialize [PointF] variable `val p` with the `j`'th entry in

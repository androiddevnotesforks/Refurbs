     * First we initialize [Boolean] variable `var growSnake` to `false`. We initialize [Coordinate]

     *  (`head.x`,`head.y-1`) and break.
     *
     *  * [SOUTH]: we set `newHead` to a new instance of [Coordinate] located at
     *  (`head.x`,`head.y+1`) and break.
     *
     * Now we check to see if we collided into a wall by checking whether the `x` field of
     * `newHead` is less 1, or the `y` field is less than 1, or the `x` field is greater than
     * [TileView.mXTileCount] minus 2, or the `y` field is greater than [TileView.mYTileCount]
     * minus 2, and if so then we set our game mode to [LOSE] and return.
     *
     * If we did not run into a wall we now look for collisions with itself by initializing [Int]
     * variable `val snakeLength` to the length of [mSnakeTrail] then looping over [Int] variable
     * `snakeIndex` for the `snakeLength` [Coordinate]'s in [mSnakeTrail] fetching each to the
     * [Coordinate] variable `val c` in turn and if it is equal to `newHead` we set our game mode
     * to [LOSE] and return.
     *
     * If we are still alive we check to see if we just ate an apple by initializing [Int] variable
     * `val appleCount` to the length of [mAppleList] then looping over [Int] variable `appleIndex`
     * for the `appleCount` [Coordinate]'s in [mAppleList] fetching each [Coordinate] to variable
     * `val c` in turn and if it is equal to `newHead` we remove `c` from [mAppleList], call our
     * method [addRandomApple] to add another randomly placed apple to the 'garden', increment our
     * score [mScore], multiply [mMoveDelay] by 0.9 and set `growSnake` to true.
     *
     * When done checking the apples we add `newHead` to [mSnakeTrail] and if `growSnake` is `false`
     * we remove the [Coordinate] at the end of [mSnakeTrail] (if it is true the snake grows larger
     * by keeping the last segment).
     *
     * Now we need to set the tile bitmaps representing [mSnakeTrail] to the correct colored one,
     * and we do this by using the [withIndex] extension function to set our [Int] variable `index`
     * to the index of the [Coordinate] in [mSnakeTrail] and our [Coordinate] variable `c` to the
     * [Coordinate] at that index in [mSnakeTrail] and looping over all the [Coordinate]'s in
     * [mSnakeTrail]:
     *  * if `index` is 0 we call our [setTile] method to set the head located at the [Coordinate.x]
     *  and [Coordinate.y] field of `c` to the [YELLOW_STAR] bitmap.
     *
     *  * otherwise we call our [setTile] method to set the segment located at the [Coordinate.x]
     *  and [Coordinate.y] field of `c` to the [RED_STAR] bitmap.
